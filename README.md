Hotel Engine Node.js Code Challenge: Github API
Requirements
Using the GitHub REST API <https://docs.github.com/en/rest>, we ask that you build an API that:
● Uses NodeJs
● Returns info for the open pull requests in a GitHub repository
● For each open PR, the number of commits is returned. (Do not use Octokit or the
GraphQL api to return this metadata. Instead, make multiple requests via the
REST api to fetch the data necessary.)
● Has one or more API endpoints.
● An interface that accepts a repository URL, for example,
<https://github.com/colinhacks/zod>.
● Implements a testing strategy (unit tests, integration tests, something else?)
Submitting
We ask that you provide us with a .zip file (which includes your version control history) or a public GitHub repository. If you add your work to your public Github, please refrain from using any reference to Hotel Engine in your code.
